# The Burger Shop 

This was the homework for week 14 of my coding boot camp. This week's challenge was to create a "burger shop" that contained a list of burgers to eat, a list of burgers that were already consumed, and a way to add more burgers to the list. Burgers you add display in the Current Menu (ready to eat) by default.  

This app is the first one I've built using the Model View Controller (MVC) design principle. The model represents the data. The view sends user actions, and the controller interprets button clicks and provides model data to the view.  

This was my very first full stack project that included a mySQL database. It was also the first full stack project where I had to learn how to connect a DB in Heroku when I deployed. 

Which burger (or burgers) will you eat?

## Technologies Used 
* Node 
* MySQL 
* NPM Packages
    * Express 
    * Handlebars 
* Hand-coded Object Relational Mapper (ORM) (as opposed to a NPM package like Sequelize)

## Features 
* View a list of burgers that are ready to eat. 
* View a list of burgers that were already consumed. 
* Add a new burger to the list. It goes into the current menu by default. 

This all sounds very simple, but learning and incorporating things like ORMs, including mySQL in the app, and deploying it all to Heroku took a lot of time. It's very important for me to understand concepts and patterns before implementing any kind of code. This also took a fair amount of debugging, which I am getting way better at. 

## Backlog 
* Mobile Responsiveness. 
* Updating the site to replace the hand-coded ORM using an NPM package called Sequelize.
* Allowing special characters in the Add Burger field (e.g.; "Karen's Burger"). 

## My Role 
I coded all aspects of this app. I also did the front end CSS. That said... 

## Shout Outs 
Coding is a social activity, and no one can do it alone. The following people helped me get through this homework: 

* My TA's and instructors. 
* My husband and peers who spent countless hours peer programming with me and helping me debug. 
* My tutor (https://github.com/edringtondc) - Check her out, she's awesome. 
* The Coding Bootcamp tutorial" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pieNMQU3oDw&list=PLJLX8sGHyHxrQpzaS6Q47lY2WusS_jc9p&index=59&t=0s
* Class resources, including the "Cat" app. 
* Myself. Because I keep on going without giving up.
